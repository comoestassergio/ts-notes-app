# Notes App Made with TypeScript
***
This is the first project I made with ***TypeScript***. 
Basically, I chose it purely to practice TS and get a hang of it. 
It uses ***Vite*** as the build tool. 
It also has Bootstrap for the styling, I decided to try something new and have a break from Tailwind.

All the notes you make are stored in the local storage. I'm planning on connecting a database in the future.

### The stack is:
- React + TypeScript
- Bootstrap
